# Dart Data Class Plugin

![Usage](img/dart-data-usage.gif)

<!-- Plugin description -->

This plugin is created for those who would like to have extra data manipulation methods in their data classes without having to write boilerplate code.

<!-- Plugin description end -->

![ScreenShot](img/generate-menu.png)

This plugin can generate the following code:
- Named Argument Constructor
- `copyWith`: copies the instance and overrides the given parameters
- `toMap`: converts your class into a map of `Map<String, dynamic>`
- `fromMap`: constructs your class from a `Map<String, dynamic>` using the named argument constructor
- all of the above with `toString`, `equals` (`==` operator), `hashcode`

## Example

Let's say you have a class called `Person` with the properties:

```dart
class Person {
  final int id;
  final String _firstName, _lastName;
  final int age;
  int? income;

  String get name => _firstName + " " + _lastName;
}
```

Using all generators of this plugin and selecting all properties, this class will look like the following. 

*(Note that some features of this generation can be customized, see details below.)*


```dart
class Person {
  final int id;
  final String _firstName, _lastName;
  final int age;
  int? income;

  String get name => _firstName + " " + _lastName;

//<editor-fold desc="Data Methods">

  Person({
    required this.id,
    required this.age,
    this.income,
    required String firstName,
    required String lastName,
  })  : _firstName = firstName,
        _lastName = lastName;

  @override
  bool operator ==(Object other) =>
      identical(this, other) ||
      (other is Person &&
          runtimeType == other.runtimeType &&
          id == other.id &&
          _firstName == other._firstName &&
          _lastName == other._lastName &&
          age == other.age &&
          income == other.income);

  @override
  int get hashCode =>
      id.hashCode ^
      _firstName.hashCode ^
      _lastName.hashCode ^
      age.hashCode ^
      income.hashCode;

  @override
  String toString() {
    return 'Person{' +
        ' id: $id,' +
        ' _firstName: $_firstName,' +
        ' _lastName: $_lastName,' +
        ' age: $age,' +
        ' income: $income,' +
        '}';
  }

  Person copyWith({
    int? id,
    String? firstName,
    String? lastName,
    int? age,
    int? income,
  }) {
    return Person(
      id: id ?? this.id,
      firstName: firstName ?? this._firstName,
      lastName: lastName ?? this._lastName,
      age: age ?? this.age,
      income: income ?? this.income,
    );
  }

  Map<String, dynamic> toMap() {
    return {
      'id': this.id,
      '_firstName': this._firstName,
      '_lastName': this._lastName,
      'age': this.age,
      'income': this.income,
    };
  }

  factory Person.fromMap(Map<String, dynamic> map) {
    return Person(
      id: map['id'] as int,
      firstName: map['_firstName'] as String,
      lastName: map['_lastName'] as String,
      age: map['age'] as int,
      income: map['income'] as int?,
    );
  }

//</editor-fold>
}
```

## Settings

![ScreenShot](img/settings-menu.png)

You can find additional settings under `Settings` > `Editor` > `Dart Data Class Plugin` where you have the following customization options:

- set the name of the copy method
- use `@required` annotation
- use `new` keyword when instantiation
- use the `const` keyword for the constructor generation - all fields in the class have to be final
- copy function can be specified to return the same instance. This Option has the same requirement as the const keyword. Useful when using Dart in a Redux architecture.
- key mapper for `toMap` and `fromMap` - use your own logic to transform the keys to their original values - useful when database result returns prefixed or uppercased result


#### Under the hood

This project is built using Kotlin and makes use of IntelliJ's PSI elements for extracting the structure of the Dart file of your selection.

### Known issues

- If the class ends with a single-line comment, code is generated from an invalid location
